# Spike-burst_chimera_states
The codes for simulating and reproducing the figures and findings presented in the paper "Spike-burst chimera states in an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuronal network". This was the final project of the "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics" course taught by Dr. Sajad Jafari in Amirkabir University of Technology in Fall 2021.

Screenshots of the source paper's figures and the generated figures are available in the report which is currently only in Persian and might be too concise. A more complete and English report / description will be added as well.
